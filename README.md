## Installation

### From PyPI

Install ProFam as a standard Python package:

```bash
uv pip install profam
```

or

```bash
pip install profam
```

### From Source

If you want the full repository workflows, example data, and inference scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex-hh/profam.git
cd profam
uv sync
profam download
```

Optional installs:

- Development tooling: `uv sync --group dev`
- FlashAttention 2: `uv sync --extra flash-attn`

If you run into CUDA or `flash-attn` issues, see [Installation Details](#installation-details).

## Quickstart

### Verify the installed package

```bash
python -c "from profam import ProFam; print('ProFam ready')"
```

### Download the pretrained model weights

The ProFam-1 model weights are hosted on Hugging Face and need to be downloaded before use (or they will be auto-downloaded on first use):

```bash
profam download
```

### Python API

The recommended way to use ProFam programmatically:

```python
from profam import ProFam

model = ProFam()  # loads checkpoint once (auto-downloads if needed)

# Generate sequences conditioned on family context
result = model.generate(
    prompt=["ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY", "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWF"],
    prompt_accessions=["seq_A", "seq_B"],  # optional: preserved in the result
    num_samples=10,
    top_p=0.95,
)
print(result.sequences)  # list of generated amino acid strings
print(result.scores)     # mean log-likelihood per sequence
# result.conditioning_prompts[i] reports the sequences/accessions that were
# actually fed to the model for ensemble prompt variant i.
for cond in result.conditioning_prompts:
    print(cond.accessions, cond.sequences)

# Score candidate sequences against a family MSA. `prompt` accepts either
# a path (FASTA / a2m / a3m) or an in-memory list[str] of sequences;
# whether the input is an aligned MSA is inferred automatically (every
# sequence must be equal length after stripping a2m/a3m insertions).
# Homology diversity weights are only meaningful for aligned inputs.

# (1) File path to an aligned MSA: diversity weights are available, and
# `cache_weights=True` writes them next to the MSA so subsequent runs skip
# the Hamming computation. `cache_weights=True` requires a file-path prompt.
result = model.score(
    sequences=["ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY", "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWF"],
    prompt="family.a3m",
    use_diversity_weights=True,  # homology-weighted prompt sub-sampling (default)
    cache_weights=True,          # cache weights next to family.a3m as family_weights.npz
    per_residue=True,            # also return per-position log-likelihoods
)
print(result.scores)          # numpy array of mean log-likelihoods
print(result.residue_scores)  # list[np.ndarray], one per scored sequence

# (2) Aligned in-memory list[str]: '-' represents gaps, lowercase letters
# and '.' are a2m/a3m insertions. Diversity weights are available because
# the sequences are equal-length after stripping insertions. There is no
# source file to cache to, so `cache_weights=True` is rejected here —
# pass a file path (example 1) to cache weights.
result = model.score(
    sequences=["ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"],
    prompt=[
        "ACDEFGHIK-LMNPQRSTVWY",
        "ACDEaFGHIK-LMNPQRSTVWY",  # lowercase 'a' is an a3m-style insertion
        "ACDE-GHIK-LMNPQRSTVWY",
    ],
    use_diversity_weights=True,
)

# (3) Unaligned in-memory list[str]: arbitrary-length sequences. Diversity
# weights are not meaningful here, so pass `use_diversity_weights=False`
# (otherwise a `ValueError` is raised).
result = model.score(
    sequences=["ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"],
    prompt=[
        "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY",
        "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVW",
        "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYAC",
    ],
    use_diversity_weights=False,
)
```

Homology diversity weights are only meaningful for aligned inputs; with
unaligned input, `use_diversity_weights=True` raises `ValueError`. Weight
caching (`cache_weights=True`) additionally requires a file-path prompt
so the cache file can be keyed to the source MSA — it is not supported
for in-memory `list[str]` prompts.

### CLI

```bash
profam generate --prompt_file family.fasta --num_samples 10
profam score --prompt_file family.a3m --candidates_file variants.csv
profam download
```

## Main Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Download checkpoint | Fetch the pretrained `ProFam-1` checkpoint | `profam download` |
| Generate sequences | Sample new sequences from family prompts | `profam generate --prompt_file ...` |
| Score sequences | Score candidate sequences with family context | `profam score --prompt_file ...` |

## Input Sequence Formats

ProFam accepts unaligned FASTA and aligned MSA (A2M / A3M) inputs. Aligned
inputs are preferred for `profam score` so homology-based diversity weights
can be computed. Before the forward pass, the model converts any input to
unaligned gap-free sequences (insertions kept):

- gaps (`-` and alignment-like `.`) are removed
- lowercase insertions are converted to uppercase
- `U -> C` and `O -> K`
- remaining out-of-vocabulary characters map to `[UNK]` only when `allow_unk=true`

## Training

Training is handled via Hydra configs and is intended for development from the source repository (not via pip-installed commands).

### Run a lightweight example

`configs/experiment/train_profam_example.yaml` is configured to run on the bundled example data:

```bash
uv run python -m profam.train experiment=train_profam_example  # requires flash-attn to be installed to support sequence packing
```

### Train with the ProFam-Atlas dataset

Training data for ProFam can be downloaded from:

- [Zenodo: ProFam Atlas Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/17713590)

The default configuration in `configs/train.yaml` is compatible with the latest ProFam-Atlas release:

```bash
uv run python -m profam.train
```

## Installation Details

### CPU-only installation

```bash
uv sync
uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

### FlashAttention 2

We recommend installing FlashAttention 2 for faster scoring and generation. For training, it is strongly recommended because ProFam uses sequence packing with `batch_size=1` and no padding.

If you need to train without Flash Attention, update the configuration to set `data.pack_to_max_tokens=null`.

```bash
uv sync --extra flash-attn
python -c "import flash_attn; print(flash_attn.__version__)"
```

### Troubleshooting: conda fallback

If a matching `flash-attn` wheel is unavailable and a source build is required, this conda-based fallback is often the easiest route:

```bash
conda create -n pfenv python=3.11 -y
conda activate pfenv

conda install -c conda-forge ninja packaging -y
conda install -c nvidia cuda-toolkit=12.4 -y

pip install profam

# install a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build (adjust CUDA version/index-url to match your setup)
pip install torch==2.5.1+cu121 torchvision==0.20.1+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

pip install setuptools wheel packaging psutil numpy
pip install flash-attn==2.5.6 --no-build-isolation

python -c "import flash_attn; print(flash_attn.__version__)"
```

## Development

We're using pre-commit to format code and pytest to run tests.

Pull requests will automatically have pre-commit and pytest run on them
and will only be approved once these checks are all passing

Before submitting a pull request, run the checks locally with:

```bash
uv run --group dev pre-commit run --all-files
```

and

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest -k 'not example'
```

Pull requests adding complex new features or making any significant changes
or additions should be accompanied with associated tests in the tests/ directory.

## Concepts

### Data loading

ProFam uses **text memmap datasets**
for fast random access over large corpora:

- `profam/data/text_memmap_datasets.py`: generic **memory-mapped** line access + index building (`*.idx.{npy,info}`)
- `profam/data/builders/family_text_memmap_datasets.py`: ProFam-Atlas-specific datasets built on top of the memmap layer

#### ProFam-Atlas on-disk format (`.mapping` / `.sequences`)

The ProFam-Atlas dataset is distributed as paired files:

- **`*.mapping`**: family id + indices into one or more `*.sequences` files
  - **Format**:
    - Line 1: `>FAMILY_ID`
    - Line 2+: `sequences_filename:idx0,idx1,idx2,...`
  - **Important**: `*.mapping` files **must not** have a trailing newline at end-of-file.
- **`*.sequences`**: FASTA-like accessions + sequences
  - **Format** (repeated):
    - `>ACCESSION ...`
    - `SEQUENCE`
  - **Important**: `*.sequences` files **should** have a final trailing newline.

See `README_ProFam_atlas.md` for examples and additional details.

#### How it’s loaded

At a high level, training loads one **protein family** at a time by:

1. Reading a family record from `MappingProteinFamilyMemmapDataset` (a memmapped `*.mapping` dataset)
2. Fetching the referenced sequences from `SequencesProteinFamilyMemmapDataset` (memmapped `*.sequences` files)
3. Building a `ProteinDocument` and preprocessing it (see `profam/data/processors/preprocessing.py`)
4. Encoding with `ProFamTokenizer` and forming batches (optionally with packing)

#### Converting FASTA → text memmap

If you have a directory of per-family FASTA files and want to create `*.mapping` / `*.sequences` files for training,
see:

- `data_creation_scripts/fasta_to_text_memmap.py`


# Experiment Log

## Initial run 

[4d2cea5](https://wandb.ai/ProFam/profam-supervised/runs/ijm5ap7s) — 2026-05-06

- Training loss goes to zero
- Val MSE on the "in prompt" values goes up at the start of starts at ~1.0 goes up to 1.6 after about 1k steps then back to 1.45 and plateus there
- Val MSE on the final value does down from 1.9 to 1.75 and stays there
- Val spearman goes to 0.15 after 2k steps and stays there, same for pearson but to 0.175
- CE loss goes up but not a lot
- Upshot: something useful is happening but the model is very bad

## Cheating by leaking normalisation

[0c32350](https://wandb.ai/ProFam/profam-supervised/runs/6n9rkqtv) — 2026-05-07

- Added `use_full_assay_stats` flag to `ProteinGymICLDataset` that, when on, normalises labelled values and the query target using `(mu, sigma)` computed over the full per-assay DMS table (cached per assay), instead of the within-context z-score from the `k` labelled examples only.
- Wired the flag through both ICL data configs and turned it on for the train and val datasets to run a "cheating" upper-bound experiment.
- Goal: test the hypothesis that the within-context normalisation scheme was holding the ICL model back, by giving it the best-case per-assay statistics it could possibly see.
- Result: training/validation behaviour was not qualitatively different from the standard within-context normalisation run — the cheating stats did not unlock noticeably better performance.
- Implication: the current ICL underperformance is unlikely to be primarily caused by the choice of normalisation statistics; the bottleneck lives elsewhere (e.g. value featurisation, head capacity, context construction, or the loss / optimisation setup).

## Cheating by observing the value

[8a15259](https://wandb.ai/ProFam/profam-supervised/runs/qbl2cbn3) — 2026-05-07

- Goal: sanity-check that the value embed/project pipeline (`value_in_proj` → hidden state → `value_out_head`) is wired up correctly end-to-end
- Method: added a `cheat_loss_on_value_slot` flag to `LlamaICLLitModule` that shifts the MSE loss from the `[VAL]` position (where the model must predict `y` before seeing it) to the `[VAL_SLOT]` position (where `y` has just been injected via the input-embedding override)
- Expectation: with the flag on, the model can trivially read `y` out of its own injected embedding via a learned linear map, so loss should crash and correlations should saturate
- Result: confirmed — within ~100 gradient steps `val/mse_loss → 0`, `val/icl_all_spearman → 1`, and `val/icl_all_pearson → 1`
- Note: `mse_loss_query` / `icl_query_*` are uninformative in cheat mode because the query position has no `[VAL_SLOT]` to land on, so only the `k` labelled positions contribute
- Conclusion: the value embedding + projection machinery is functioning correctly; any failure to learn in the normal (non-cheat) regime is a representation/optimisation problem upstream of these two heads, not a bug in them
